CREATING THE FOREST_AREA TABLE
Remeber the title of the headers in the csv file. 

For the forest_area.csv file, they are: 
country_code, 
country_name, 
year, 
forest_area_sqkm

For the land_area.csv file, the headers are:
country_code,
country_name,
year,
total_area_sq_mi

For the regions.csv file, the headers are:
country_name,
country_code,
region,
income_group

NOW LET'S GO AHEAD AND CREATE THE FIRST TABLE: forest_area

STEP 1: Create the table in pgAdmin. Simply right-click on "Table" in the tree on the left and select Query Tool.

Then copy and paste the code below and run it.

CREATE TABLE forest_area
(country_code varchar,
country_name varchar,
year varchar,
forest_area_sqkm varchar
);

STEP 2: Import the Data from the CSV file (forest_area.csv) into the newly created forest_area table.

Simply right-click on your table in the tree on the left and select the Import/Exportâ€¦ menu item.
A window will appear with the slider set to Import. Then select the source file and set the format to CSV. Set the Header to Yes if your file has a header. 
The only thing left is to select the delimiter (usually a comma). 

Your window should look like this:


Now repeat the same step above for the remaining 2 tables (land_area & regions), but changing the code to reflect the different headers in each table.


CREATE THE 2ND TABLE: land_area

STEP 1: Create the land_area table in pgAdmin. Simply right-click on "Table" in the tree on the left and select Query Tool. 
Then copy and paste the code below and run it.

CREATE TABLE land_area
(country_code varchar,
country_name varchar,
year varchar,
total_area_sq_mi varchar
);


STEP 2: Import the Data from the CSV file (land_area.csv) into the newly created land_area table.


FINALLY, CREATE THE 3RD TABLE: regions

STEP 1: 

CREATE TABLE regions
(country_name varchar,
country_code varchar,
region varchar,
income_group varchar
);

STEP 2: Import the Data from the CSV file (regions.csv) into the newly created region table.
