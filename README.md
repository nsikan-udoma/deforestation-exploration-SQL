# deforestation-project #SQL

ForestQuery, a non-profit organization on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world and raise awareness about this important environmental topic, needed my services as a Data Analyst to work and query their database with data dealing with forestation as well as total land area and region groupings. 

This Project involved an exploratory analysis of the Global Deforestation Trends from 1990 to 2016. It was done using SQL connecting multiple tables to one another with data obtained from the World Bank. 

At the end of the project, I submitted a report to the leadership team to help them understand the global deforestation overview between 1990 and 2016. This report contains findings and insights that brings to light areas of concern as well as opportunities to address the rapid deforestation rate globally.

Find attached, the report for your review.
